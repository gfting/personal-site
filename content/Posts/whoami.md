My name is Gabriel Ting, and I begin this blog at a pivotal moment in my career. I just officially submitted to transfer to the School of Engineering, despite completing many liberal arts requirements. Not only that, but I also had previously written a 25-page research paper for the College Honors Scholars program on Aum Shinrikyo, and am only 2 classes away from finishing my Asian Studies second (now tertiary) major.
