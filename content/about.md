#### Hi, I'm Gabriel Ting, a sophomore at Vanderbilt University triple majoring in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Asian Studies. This is my blog, a space to put things that are an intersection of personal and professional interests. 

I built this blog with Hugo and Netlify–I still have my [separate old porfolio site](https://gabrielting.com). As I move through my life, I hope that this will serve as a record for what I've done, places I've been, and what I hope to do.
