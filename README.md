# My Personal Website
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e8e261ed-cb1a-4900-8f24-091ee153670b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gfting/deploys)
## Overview
I created this website for personal usage, based on the theme by https://atlialp.com/. It hosts my résumé, writings, and a brief overview of my portfolio. It's a transition from my old website located at https://gabrielting.com, and I'll be updating this over the next few weeks as I finish up with finals at school. Stay tuned! 

A live version of this website is located at https://gfting.dev!
