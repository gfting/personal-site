# My Personal Website

## Overview
I created this website for personal usage. It hosts my résumé, writings, and a brief overview of my portfolio. It's a transition from my old website located at https://gabrielting.com, and I'll be updating this over the next few weeks as I finish up with finals at school. Stay tuned! 

A live version of this website is located at https://gfting.dev!
